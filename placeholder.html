    <h1>This is a placeholder for all the resourses I don't have.</h1>
    <p>I only have a few technical projects to speak of and I don't have social media or a resume.</p>
    <p>I am not going to be searching for a job after the program, so this project for me is just for learning purposes. <strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
